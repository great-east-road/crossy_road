* Obstales -> Stuff that blocks the player, like buildings, logs to stand on, trees, etc. Probably also things that kill the player like trains
* Player -> Frog models, pretty much. Or any other hero we decide to use
* Worlds -> Levels that the frog can play on. These would probably have obstacles linked-in from the blend files in the obstacles folder, I guess
