# Assets - Work Folder

Use this folder to organize asset files that we're working on.

**Example**: Maybe we found a building asset online. We place building.blend in the downloads folder. We then copy building.blend somewhere in *this* structure, and work on the copy here. That way, the original download is untouched (because re-downloading from blendeswap is expensive).

# Creating Assets
We'll be using `MagicaVoxel` to create and export our assets.
The program could be found [here](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=mv_main). Just download and extract the `.zip` file.

## Exporting Assets
When you save your asset the file extensions will be `.vox`. To export to UE4, go to the bottom of the `project` panel on the right, you will see `export` on the bottom. Export the project as a `.obj` file.

**Note**: all `.obj` and `.vox` files should be saved into the `project-06-crossy-road-resources\assets-work\obstacles\voxel` directory.
